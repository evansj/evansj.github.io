  My name is Jon Evans, I used to be quite active in the BMW 7 Series (E32) community,
  as I owned a 735iL, and I have a lot of information available in the BMW Repairs
  section of the site.
  From August 2004 to April 2011 I owned a Lexus LS400 Mk. IV. I have a Lexus Repairs
  section, but it is fairly empty because nothing much seemed to go wrong with it.
  In April 2011 I replaced the Lexus with a nearly-new Toyota Prius, the main aim
  being to reduce my expenditure on petrol. With rising petrol prices the Lexus was
  hovering at just under Â£100 per tank, which would last about 350 miles.
  I live in Banbury, UK, with my wife Heidi and children James and Matthew.
