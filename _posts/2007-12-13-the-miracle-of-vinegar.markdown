There are
[many](http://www.zetatalk.com/shelter/tshlt05p.htm)
[web](https://lifehacker.com/software/diy/diy-window-de+icer-on+the+cheap-327068.php) pages making grand claims for the number of problems which can supposedly be solved by using vinegar.
One that I've read quite often is that you can prevent your car windows from icing up. For example,
here's a quote from ["Chef Noah"](https://web.archive.org/web/20090222140032/http://www.chefnoah.com/vinegar.htm):

> **Prevent ice from forming on a car windshield overnight.**  
> Coat the window with a solution of three parts white or vinegar to one part water.

I decided to try it last night. I mixed white vinegar and water in the designated proportions, put it in a misting bottle, and sprayed it all over my windscreen and rear screen. Then I went to bed safe in the knowledge that I'd be leaping happily into my car in the morning and driving off while all my neighbours stared enviously at my frost-free car.

Well, I'm not very happy to report that this morning there was absolutely no change in the amount of ice on my screen. Furthermore, I don't even think it was a particularly cold night last night - it was only about -1&deg;C when I went out to the car in the morning. Don't these sites test their tips before posting them? So I got cold hands as usual. Bah.
