My car got hit on the way home from work this evening!  Early indications are that I definitely need a new grille, and more than likely a new bonnet.  I will know better when I see it in the light tomorrow morning.

I was driving home this evening on an extremely icy road when I had to stop because a car had gone off the road in the distance. While I was stopped the traffic coming the other way continued to move slowly. Just as an articulated lorry was drawing level with me a gust of wind blew it sideways, and it slowly moved across the road, going down the side of a Golf in front of me and ending up resting on the front of my bonnet.

Here's a couple of images I took at the scene with my phone.
