This site is currently hosted at my house, and is being served to you via my ADSL connection.  At the moment the link seems to be up and down like a hooker's pants, and apparently BT have scheduled a replacement fibre optic cable in the exchange to fix it.  The work is supposed to happen on the 10th Feb, in the meantime I'm afraid we'll all have to live with it.
