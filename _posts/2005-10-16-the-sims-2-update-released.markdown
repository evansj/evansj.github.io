Their last comment is so true!  Number of times I've played *The Sims 2* since I last blogged about it? *Zero*.  Total number of times I've played it since I bought it? *One*.

I wrote to Aspyr Support, saying how disappointed I was with the performance of The Sims 2 on my G4 Powerbook, and asking if I could swap it for a copy of The Sims 1.  Their answer: it works fine, and no, you can't swap it.

If I ever buy another game again, it will be for a Playstation or an XBox (which I will have to purchase at the same time because I don't own one at the moment).
