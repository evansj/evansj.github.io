*Step 1* remove the switch by prising it out of the driver's door. The clips
are in the middle of the top and bottom of the switch.

*Step 2* Holding the switch with the connectors upwards, prise the back off by
easing open the clips on each side.

*Step 3* clean the gold contacts on the circuit board

*Step 4* clip the switch back together (keep the switch facing down and place
the circuit board on top, then click it back into place

*Step 5* plug it back in :-)
