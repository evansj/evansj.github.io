Last Saturday we went to [Legoland Windsor](http://www.legoland.co.uk/)
because they had a special Monster Truck weekend.  Heidi, James and Matthew already have
annual passes, so they got in free, it cost me &pound;30.  They were running a special offer
in the shop though, where you got a free annual pass voucher if you spent over &pound;50.
Well, Christmas is coming up in the not too distant future, and I've had my eye on
the new [Mindstorms NXT](http://mindstorms.lego.com/) since they announced it in
January.  It was &pound;179 but with James's annual pass discount it came down to about
&pound;161.  I was very pleased though when I received __three__ annual pass vouchers.
In the meantime Heidi had been in another queue buying Matthew a LEGO train set
(set [7897](https://brickset.com/sets/7897-1/Passenger-Train)), which also netted us a voucher.
So in the end we came away with &pound;290 worth of annual passes (2006 prices) and
&pound;260 worth of LEGO, for an outlay of &pound;224 (or &pound;254 if you include the
&pound;30 it cost me to get in the park).  I don't know if the offer's still running
but I hope they do it again next year!

Now the only problem is that the boxes have been put away, as they are for Christmas.
So now I'm counting the days until Christmas.  I mean, James is.  It's his present, right?
