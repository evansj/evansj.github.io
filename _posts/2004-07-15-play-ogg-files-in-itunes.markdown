<p>A colleague brought in a load of ogg files.  Could he play them under iTunes?  No problem!  Here's how:
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a class="external" href="http://qtcomponents.sf.net/">QT Components</a> SourceForge page and download the plugin (there are versions for Windows and Mac</li>
<li>Inside the disk image you'll find a readme file and OggVorbis.component.  Put OggVorbis.component in /Library/QuickTime (as described in the readme)</li>
<li>Restart iTunes and it will work!</li>
</ol>
Ogg files now import into iTunes, and most of the metadata works as well. If you "Get Info..." on an ogg file you'll find it listed as a <i>QuickTime movie file</i>.  You won't be able to attach artwork.
