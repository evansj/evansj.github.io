I know I'm a bit behind in bloging about this, because it has 
[already](http://www.tuaw.com/2007/04/12/apple-announces-leopard-delays-due-to-the-iphone/)
[been](http://www.macrumors.com/2007/04/12/what-we-learn-from-leopards-delay/)
[done](http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/04/13/analysts.on.leopard.delay/)
[to](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/04/13/top_secret_features_suspect_in_apples_leopard_delay.html)
[death](http://blogs.business2.com/apple/2007/04/leopard_delay_o.html)
in the blogshpere, 
but something occurred to me this morning. Apple have [announced](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/04-12-2007/0004564657&EDATE=) that Leopard will be shipping in
October, but [previous experience](http://evansweb.info/articles/2007/01/17/ready-to-ship-february)
shows that what they mean by "ship Leopard in October" is probably "ship Leopard on October 31st",
and therefore we probably won't actually get our hands on a copy of Leopard until a few days
into November.
