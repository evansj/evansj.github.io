I know I'm a bit behind in bloging about this, because it has already been done to death in the blogshpere, but something occurred to me this morning.

(2019-02-28: removed dead links to stories on tuaw.com, macrumours.com, macnn.com, appleinsider.com, and business2.com)

Apple have [announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20150928171637/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apple-statement-58308972.html) that Leopard will be shipping in October, but [previous experience]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2007-01-17-ready-to-ship-february %}) shows that what they mean by "ship Leopard in October" is probably "ship Leopard on October 31st", and therefore we probably won't actually get our hands on a copy of Leopard until a few days into November.
