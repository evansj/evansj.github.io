Ho hum.  It seems that in every sphere of life, there is scum.  I've just spent 1/2 an hour deleting comment spam.  Sorry if you read any of it and found it offensive.  I've changed the site configuration so that you have to register before you can post.  Another example of idiots making life difficult for everyone else.
