<p><a class="external" href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> recently announced that the next version of <a class="external" href="https://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> (codenamed Tiger) will include the <a class="external" href="https://github.com/timothystone/blojsom">Blojsom</a> blog package.</p>

<p>Since I am both a Mac user, and a Java developer (Blojsom is written in Java) I decided to download the latest version and try it out.</p>

<p>Up until now I've been using <a class="external" href="https://www.geeklog.net/">geeklog</a>, which is fine and all that, but to be honest I've never been particularly fond of <a class="external" href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.
I don't like the way that the site content and logic is all crammed together in each file.
I've only just started to scratch the surface of Blojsom, but it seems to use a much more favourable design, with pages built up from <a class="external" href="https://velocity.apache.org">Velocity</a> templates.
