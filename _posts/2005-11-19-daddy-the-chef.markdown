Conversation at our house earlier today:

*Heidi:* I'm just going to buy some milk from the shop over the road<br/>
*James:* Why?<br/>
*Heidi:* Because daddy's going to do some cooking<br/>
*Matthew:* What's he making?<br/>
*Heidi:* Well, what's the only thing he knows how to cook?<br/>
*James:* Pancakes!<br/>
*Matthew:* Tea!<br/>
*Me:* What?  Cheeky little... I have a bigger cooking repertoire than just pancakes and tea!<br/>
*James:*  [after a perfect comedic pause] ...coffee...
