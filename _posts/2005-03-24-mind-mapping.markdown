<p>Further to <a href="http://evansweb.info/blojsom/blog/default/Mac/2005/03/24/More_software_Ive_bought_for_my_Mac.txt">my post</a> which included details of <a href="http://www.nova-mind.com/">NovaMind</a>&mdash; if you're looking for some <a href="http://www.mind-map.com/">Mind Mapping</a> software and don't want to spend any money, you should investigate <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/">FreeMind</a>.  It's available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux,&hellip; in fact any OS with a JVM (because it's a <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> app).  It works great, but it has fewer features than NovaMind.</p>

<p>One of the nice things about Open Source software is the developers by and large aren't bothered that users might somehow find out about a competing product and switch to it.  In fact they are usually quite open about other products already available.  If you take a look at the FreeMind Wiki pages you'll find an entry for  <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page#Alternatives_to_using_FreeMind">Alternatives to using FreeMind</a>, which lists some other free and commercial Mind Mapping programs.  I see that sort of thing quite often on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS" title="Free/Libre Open Source Software">FOSS</a> sites, and it always makes me smile.  You just don't normally see information like that on commercial software sites.</p>
