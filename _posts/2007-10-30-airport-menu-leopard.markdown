Here's the [Mac OS X Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/ "Apple - Mac OS X Leopard") version of the Airport menu shown in the previous post:

The lock icons are presumably quite useful for some people, although I only ever connect to either my
home or office network so I never really even look at the menu.
