The body shop has confirmed that the bonnet is beyond repair, so have submitted a quote to replace the bonnet and front grilles, and straighten the metal panel in front of the top of the radiator.  The labour comes to &pound;360, the paint and materials &pound;155, and of course the parts need buying as well.  I have sent the quote to my insurance company and I await their decision.
