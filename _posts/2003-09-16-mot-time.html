My MOT certificate was due to run out tomorrow so I got my car tested today.  It failed because the offside headlamp was aimed too high, which was easily fixed and it passed on a re-test.

The emissions test went well, for a 12 year old car with more than 130,000 miles on the clock.  The results are reproduced below:
