According to the [Universal Currency Converter](http://www.xe.net/ucc/), the Sterling to Dollar exchange rate at the moment is 1 GBP = 1.74676 USD.

iTunes UK sells singles for &pound;0.79, the US store sells them for $0.99.  This means that singles bought from the UK store cost $1.38, making them 39% more expensive.

Music videos from the UK store sell for a massive &pound;1.89 ($3.30), compared to $1.99 which Apple charge for videos on the US store.  i.e. UK customers are charged 66% more for videos.

If the rates were the same (according to [UCC](http://www.xe.net/ucc/)) the cost in the UK for singles and videos would be &pound;0.57 and &pound;1.14 respectively.
