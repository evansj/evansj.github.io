<p>According to <code>/usr/share/calendar/calendar.history</code> on my PowerBook, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0080455/">The Blues Brothers</a> premiered in Chicago on 16th June 1980.  That would make it 25 years old today.</p>
<p>There was a period in my life when I watched that film virtually every weekend. :-)</p>
