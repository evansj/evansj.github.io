I once bought a computer game called *Alone in the Dark*.  In fact, spinning around on my office chair I can see that the box is still sat there on my shelf.  It turns out that they've made a [feature film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369226/) out of it.  It's getting [amazing reviews](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alone_in_the_dark/), here are some samples:

> The three stars have seen better days, but I'd like to think they could
> still do something classier and more dignified than this. Like gay porn.
>
> -- Rob Vaux, FLIPSIDE MOVIE EMPORIUM

> It's only January, but I can't imagine any upcoming film replacing
> 'Alone in the Dark' as my leading candidate for Worst Movie of 2005.
>
> -- Betty Jo Tucker, REELTALK MOVIE REVIEWS

> Saying Uwe Boll's *Alone in the Dark* is better than his 2003 American
> debut *House of the Dead* is akin to praising syphilis for not being HIV.
>
> -- Nicholas Schager, SLANT MAGAZINE

> ...asking the viewer to accept Tara Reid as a scientist is pure insanity,
> requiring a staggering leap of faith that I can't even begin to contemplate.
>
> -- David Nusair, REEL FILM REVIEWS

> *Alone in the Dark* co-stars perpetual party-girl Tara Reid as an
> archeologist. That alone should give you some clue as to how bad this
> movie is.
>
> -- Bob Townsend, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION

> As video game adaptations go, even *Pong: The Movie* would have a lot
> more personality.
>
> -- Michael Rechtshaffen, HOLLYWOOD REPORTER
