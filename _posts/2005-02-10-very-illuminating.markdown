Last week I had a sudden revelation, and replaced the 60W incandescent bulb in my desk light with an 11W low energy bulb.
Like most people these days, I have these bulbs fitted in many of the lights in the house.  For some reason I never thought to put one in my desk light.  It used to be too hot to touch within 5 minutes of switching it on, now it runs cool and remains easy to move around.

Yes, I know I sound like a bit of a dork putting that in my blog. :)

P.S. My desk light is an old original <a href="http://www.luxous.com/">Luxo</a> L-1, with a clamp rather than a base.  My father-in-law gave it me when he rescued it from the office where he worked.
