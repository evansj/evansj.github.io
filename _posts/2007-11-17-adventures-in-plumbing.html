I fixed the cistern in our toilet this evening. For the last few months it has been making a noise like a tuba every time it fills up. Turns out the valve just needed dismantling and cleaning. While I was in there I found an alternative valve insert which the manufacturers had provided in case you have low water pressure. Well, our water pressure is really high, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. I connected of all up and flushed, and it was an amazing spectacle. It filled the cistern with a deluge of water in about 20 seconds. I decided that the valve probably couldn't cope with that long term, so I put the old one back. At least I silenced the toilet tuba.
