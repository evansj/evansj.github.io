Well the plans for today's work went out the window when we were hit with a heavy rainstorm over my lunch break.  Then after work I got about 5 minutes before it clouded over and the rain started again.I got as far as removing the existing speaker wiring.  It's been installed by the previous owner, and consists of some quite good quality cable, and Rockford Fosgate crossovers for the front bass, mid and treble speakers.  I'm replacing the cable and routing it better, but I'll save the crossover networks and re-use them (why not? They probably cost a fortune).
