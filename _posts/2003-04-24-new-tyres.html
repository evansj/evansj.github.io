I had some new rear tyres fitted today by the garage at the end of my road, STS (I would provide a URL but they don't appear to be online).They also did the tracking and the handling has improved yet again, they have virtually eliminated the pull to the right that the car used to have.The tyres are Nankang 225/50 VR 15 and they cost me about &pound;55 each including fitting, balancing and VAT.  The alignment cost &pound;35.
