The only piece of DOS or Windows shareware that I ever registered was a message editor for FidoNet called GoldEd.
</p><p>
Through many years of Linux usage, I was sort of proud of the fact that I didn't need to buy any software for it, because everything I needed was available as Open Source.  In a previous job I did buy an excellent piece of Linux backup software called Arkeia.
</p><p>
Since switching to Mac, I have bought the following software:
</p>
<h4>Shareware</h4>
<h5>Applications</h5>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.circusponies.com/">Notebook (Circus Ponies)</a>
<br/>
I hardly ever use it to be honest.</li>


<li><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/pro/">OmniGraffle Pro</a> (<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">The Omni Group</a>)
<br/>
Very useful for doing nice network diagrams for work.  I also used it to make a plan of my bathroom at home.</li>


<li><a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a> (<a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Kula Co, Ltd.</a>)
<br/>
Using it right now. :-)  It's a nice way to keep my blog posts organised, but I <em>hate</em> the way it messes up all of my carefully hand crafted HTML if I switch to Rich Text mode.</li>


<li><a href="http://freshlysqueezedsoftware.com/products/pulpfiction/">Pulp Fiction</a> (<a href="http://freshlysqueezedsoftware.com/">Freshly Squeezed Software</a>)
<br/>
It starts up when I log in and runs all day.  Without it I'd spend a lot more time clicking around the web.</li>


<li><a href="http://www.objectpark.net/letterstar.html">Letter Star</a> (<a href="http://www.objectpark.net/">Objectpark Software</a>)
<br/>
I hardly ever use it, but when I do it does its job with no fuss</li>



<li><a href="http://www.aquafold.com/">Aqua Data Studio (Aquafold Inc.)</a>
<br/>
Java version of MS SQL Server Manager.  I use it quite often at work.</li>

</ul>


<h5>Utilities</h5>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.objectpark.net/mcc.html">Menu Calendar Clock</a> (<a href="http://www.objectpark.net/">Objectpark Software</a>)
<br/>
Runs on bootup, I don't use its Ã¢â‚¬Å“special featuresÃ¢â‚¬Â all that much, but I appreciate the fact that I can customise the time format in the menu bar.  I have (at the moment) Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fri 4 Feb 12:26Ã¢â‚¬Â
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/sidetrack/">Side Track</a> (<a href="http://www.ragingmenace.com/">Raging Menace</a>)
<br/>
Superb piece of work!  I can't live without the side scroll-wheel emulation.
</li>

<li><a href="http://clicker.salling.com/">Salling Clicker</a> (<a href="http://www.salling.com/">Salling Software AB.</a>)
<br/>
I used to use it loads, now not so much.  Now I've got iWork I might use it more so I can control Keynote from my phone.
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> (<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/">Rogue Amoeba</a>)
<br/>
Comes in handy every so often.  Nice for archiving material from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/">BBC Radio player</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/">Konfabulator (Pixoria Inc.)</a>
<br/>
It was a cool gadget for a week or so.  Then I just got bored with it.  These days I never use it.
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.iconfactory.com/xs_home.asp">xScope</a> (<a href="http://www.artissoftware.com/">ARTIS Software</a> & <a href="http://www.iconfactory.com/">The Iconfactory</a>)
<br/>
It works great when I don't have an external monitor plugged into my PowerBook.  When I do, xScope crashes when the Loupe tool moves across to the other screen.  I've reported the bug twice over the last year, and even had an email confirmation of the bug, but they still haven't fixed it.
</li>

</ul>

<h4>Commercial Applications</h4>
<ul>
<li>iLife '04 (<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife '05</a> (<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>)
<br/>
I use iPhoto quite a lot.  I ordered my first Photo Ã¢â‚¬Å“BookÃ¢â‚¬Â the other day.  I bought a DV Camcorder just after Christmas so I'll be making a lot more use of iMovie and iDVD soon.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork '05</a> (<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>)
<br/>
I've only just got this, but it looks really good.  I'm working on a presentation in Keynote, and I've written a few letters in Pages.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/upgrade/">Quicktime Pro</a> (<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>)
<br/>
Well worth it and only a few quid.
</li>
<li>Photoshop Elements 2.0 (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>) (came <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000D1JAX">bundled with a Wacom Graphire 3 graphics tablet</a>)
<br/>
I don't use the tablet as much as I thought I would.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopelmac/main.html">Photoshop Elements 3.0</a> (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>)
<br/>
I wish I could afford the full version of PhotoShop.  Every tutorial ever written seems to assume you're not using Elements.  The main thing I wish Elements had was guides.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don't know what this proves.  Mac users buy more software?  Mac users don't mind paying for good software?
</p>
<p>At some point I should dig out the receipts and add up what I've spent so far...</p>
