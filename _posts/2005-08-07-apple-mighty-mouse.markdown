As [previously stated]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2005-07-04-microsoft-intellimouse-explorer %}), at work I use a [Logitech&reg; MX&trade;1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Logitech_products#Optical_mice) mouse. (Aside: is it just me, or do you hate it when companies litter their product names with &reg;&trade; symbols?  I like to stick it to them by vocalizing them. "Yeah, I really love the Logitech ar em ex tee em one-thousand, it's great!)

Anyway, [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) have just brought out a new mouse called the **Mighty Mouse**, and the other day (yeah, OK, the day it was announced...) I drove to the [Birmingham Apple Store](https://www.apple.com/uk/retail/birmingham/) to try one out.  They didn't have any in stock, so I left empty handed.  I'll probably wait for the Bluetooth version now.

Oh, when I said I left empty handed, I did in fact leave with an **iPod Shuffle Sports Case** and a copy of **The Sims 2**.

Don't make the same mistake I did!  If you have a G4 Mac (like my 15" PowerBook), *don't* buy The Sims 2.  It runs like a dog on the G4.  You get about 3 frames per second if there are more than about 4 Sims in your house.

I bet The Sims (version 1) would run fine - I wish I'd bought that instead.
