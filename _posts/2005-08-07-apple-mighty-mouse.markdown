As [previously stated](/articles/2005/07/04/microsoft-intellimouse-explorer), at work I use a [Logitech&reg; MX&trade;1000](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/GB/EN,CRID=2135,CONTENTID=9043) mouse. (Aside: is it just me, or do you hate it when companies litter their product names with &reg;&trade; symbols?  I like to stick it to them by vocalizing them. "Yeah, I really love the Logitech ar em ex tee em one-thousand, it's great!)

Anyway, [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) have just brought out a new mouse called the [Mighty Mouse](http://www.apple.com/uk/mightymouse/), and the other day (yeah, OK, the day it was announced...) I drove to the [Birmingham Apple Store](http://www.apple.com/uk/retail/bullring/) to try one out.  They didn't have any in stock, so I left empty handed.  I'll probably wait for the Bluetooth version now.

Oh, when I said I left empty handed, I did in fact leave with an [iPod Shuffle Sports Case](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodshuffle/accessories.html) and a copy of [The Sims 2](http://www.aspyr.com/games.php/mac/10880/).

Don't make the same mistake I did!  If you have a G4 Mac (like my 15" PowerBook), *don't* by The Sims 2.  It runs like a dog on the G4.  You get about 3 frames per second if there are more than about 4 Sims in your house.

I bet The Sims (version 1) would run fine - I wish I'd bought that instead.
