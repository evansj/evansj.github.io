<p>I once bought a computer game called <em>Alone in the Dark</em>.  In fact, spinning around on my office chair I can see that the box is still sat there on my shelf.  It turns out that they've made a <a href="http://www.aloneinthedarkthemovie.com/">feature film</a> out of it.  It's getting <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alone_in_the_dark/">amazing reviews</a>, here are some samples:</p>

<blockquote><p>The three stars have seen better days, but I'd like to think they could still do something classier and more dignified than this. Like gay porn.<br/>-- <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/author-4503/">Rob Vaux</a>, FLIPSIDE MOVIE EMPORIUM</p>

<blockquote><p>
It's only January, but I can't imagine any upcoming film replacing 'Alone in the Dark' as my leading candidate for Worst Movie of 2005.<br/>-- <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/author-5761/">Betty Jo Tucker</a>, REELTALK MOVIE REVIEWS

<blockquote><p>
Saying Uwe BollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <em>Alone in the Dark</em> is better than his 2003 American debut <em>House of the Dead</em> is akin to praising syphilis for not being HIV.<br/>-- <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/author-4148/">Nicholas Schager</a>, SLANT MAGAZINE

<blockquote><p>
...asking the viewer to accept Tara Reid as a scientist is pure insanity, requiring a staggering leap of faith that I can't even begin to contemplate.<br/>-- <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/author-1339/">David Nusair</a>, REEL FILM REVIEWS

<blockquote><p>
<em>Alone in the Dark</em> co-stars perpetual party-girl Tara Reid as an archeologist. That alone should give you some clue as to how bad this movie is.<br/>-- <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/author-8939/">Bob Townsend</a>, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION

<blockquote><p>
As video game adaptations go, even <em>Pong: The Movie</em> would have a lot more personality.<br/>-- <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/author-3333/">Michael Rechtshaffen</a>, HOLLYWOOD REPORTER
