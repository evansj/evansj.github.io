I had a minor issue with the centre rear seat of my MINI a few weeks ago. I pulled the catch so that I could drop down the middle section, and heard a pinging noise from behind the handle. Although the catch still worked fine, it seemed a bit looser than it used to be, and also there was a rattle coming from inside.

For very minor things like this I'm always too embarrassed to take it back to the dealer so I decided to try to fix it myself.

Removing the surround from the handle was surprisingly difficult because it was almost impossible to work out where to pry it to release it from its catches. As you can see from the photo, I managed to wreck two of the catches. I think the technique is probably to insert a fairly sturdy plastic tool in horizontally under the sides of the surround, then move it vertical and slide it down the side of the clip, then move it to the side to compress the side inwards.

I bent the broken parts back and glued them with superglue. I figured if it doesn't work I can always get a replacement part from the dealer.

The next step is to remove the headrest, and then remove the tubes that the headrest slides into. This is another difficult job! The tubes are secured into the seat by two small clips about two thirds of the way down inside the tubes. They are oriented to the left/right of the car. I was able to use a dental pick to pull them into the tube, but I then had to use quite a lot of force to pull them out.
