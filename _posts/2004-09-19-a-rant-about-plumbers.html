Why is it so hard to get a plumber?  Why is it just accepted that you make an appointment for a plumber to come round, then they just don't turn up?  Why did I waste my time leaving work early today?

Seriously, I'm sat here with a crap bathroom and many thousands of pounds sat in my bank account waiting for a plumber to take it off my hands in exchange for fitting a new one.  If you are a plumber and want more information then please contact me at jon.evans@pobox.com.  I live in Banbury, Oxfordshire.

*Update 24/09/2003*: the plumber came round on Monday, and if his quote is OK we should be able to get the job done next month sometime.  So we might be OK.  Plumbers, you can stop the barrage of email now (none received as of this posting...).

*Update 06/08/2005*: As I'm importing all of my posts from my old site, I thought I'd add a comment to this one.  We did end up getting the bathroom done by this plumber, and it cost us over &pound;5,000.  The workmanship was utter crap, and I ended up removing every bathroom fitting installed by the plumber and installing it all again myself.  Moral: DIY is the way to go.
