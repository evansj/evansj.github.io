This weekend we dug the [breadmaker](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0000C72WQ?ie=UTF8&tag=evanswebinfo-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B0000C72WQ)
out of the cupboard and attempted to make some raisin bread. It's been ages since
I last used it, and I vaguely remember that I used to have to put more water in than it said
in the official recipe, otherwise it came out wrong.

Anyway, I decided to stick with the recipe for the first attempt, and we ended up after two
and a half hours with a stodgy loaf of bread only 5cm high.

It still smelled great, and the boys and I were starving, so we decided to try it anyway -- and
it wasn't too bad actually -- tasty, but very, very stodgy.

While we were all struggling to eat a slice each, I wondered out loud whether mummy would
like to try it. Matthew looked at me and said "I think it's boy's bread really".

P.S. The next 3 loaves were no better.
