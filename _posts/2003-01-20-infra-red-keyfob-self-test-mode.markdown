To test the transmit / receive LEDs built into the keyfob, point it at
a reflective surface, about 10mm away, and hold down the "unlock" button.
After blinking the LED a few times it will light up continuously to confirm
that all is well.  To verify that it really did do the test, try it again
without pointing it at a surface (just point it into space somewhere), and the
LED stays unlit after the initial blinking.
