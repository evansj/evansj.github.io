The site is now (as you can plainly see) back online. I was running out of disk space so I took the opportunity to upgrade my operating system at the same time as fitting a new hard drive.  I now have a 120GB hard drive with a fresh installation of [Gentoo Linux](http://www.gentoo.org/) occupying a small fraction of the space available.
