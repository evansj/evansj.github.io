<p>What amazing news.  The European Parliament <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4655955.stm">voted 648 to 14 to reject the Computer Implemented Inventions directive</a>.

This is almost better news than the announcement that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/4655555.stm">London will host the 2012 Olympic Games</a>.
