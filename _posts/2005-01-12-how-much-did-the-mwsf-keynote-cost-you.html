<p>Answer: &pound;98.  I ordered <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork 05</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife 05</a> last night as soon as I'd finished watching <a href="http://stream.apple.akadns.net/">the keynote</a>.  Which took until 2am because the rest of the world was also trying to watch it.</p>

<p>The 1GB <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod shuffle</a> can also serve as a plain 1GB USB memory stick, so I'll probably get one at some point.  It would also be nice to replace the Windows box in the basement with a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a>.  It's pretty much only used by my kids for browsing <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/">Cbeebies</a>.</p>
