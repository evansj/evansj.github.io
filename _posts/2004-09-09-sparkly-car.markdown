I had my car valeted today.  It's something I've only had done (to this extent) once before, that was about three years ago when I was returning a company car that I hadn't kept particularly clean.

Anyway, I went for the full package, including engine bay clean and prep.  It cost me &pound;79 but I think it was worth it.  I am going to try and make an effort to keep it "topped up" to this cleanliness level.  The valeting company I used do a cheaper Wash &amp; Vac service at &pound;15, which I might take advantage of every so often.

Anyway, I took some pictures.
