This is my favourite bit from recent TV adverts:

<img src="/files/winner-1.gif" height="240" width="320" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Michael Winner" title="Michael Winner" />

Don't have nightmares.

[Edit 2007-01-05] It's from one of those ESure adverts. I don't think they show it anymore.
