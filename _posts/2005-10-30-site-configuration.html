This evening I went through my log files and identified a load of URLs from my old site which are now invalid, and made them redirect to the new pages.

My 10 most popular articles are:

If you're reading this on my RSS or atom feed and you haven't had any updates for a while, it's because the old RSS and atom URLs were two of the ones that were broken.

I get loads of links from BMW forums such as [7-Forum.com](http://www.7-forum.com/) (German) [Roadfly](http://www.roadfly.com/) and [bimmer.info](http://www.bimmer.info/).  Hi guys! I might get another BMW one day.  Maybe when the second hand price of the E65 comes down a bit.
