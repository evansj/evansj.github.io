From the BBC comes [a report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4260000/newsid_4267200/4267244.stm) about various false callouts that the [RSPCA](http://www.rspca.org.uk/) have attended over the last year.

My favourite was this one:

> A woman rang to say the 'beast of Bodmin' had been asleep on her doorstep for 24 hours. It was
> actually a new telephone directory wrapped in black plastic.

This one was also quite amusing:

> A member of the public reported a dead horse in a flooded field,
> which was actually a large plank of wood.
