Sorry I haven't posted much up lately.  I haven't done anything to the car because I have no off-street parking, and it's been too dark at night to do anything when I get home from work.

Hopefully this will change as the evenings get longer.  I have a few miscellaneous DIY jobs lined up, including sorting my headlight washers (I have a new spray nozzle to fit, and I think there is a leak from the tank) and re-cabling my speakers.
