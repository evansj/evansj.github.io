Finally I have stopped procrastinating, and repaired my broken mouse.  The cable must have had a break in it where it exited the mouse, so I've shortened it by about 5cm and resoldered it.  I know it's an ancient mouse but it now works again and it's saved me the hassle of buying a new one.  Also it saves it from adding to some landfill site somewhere.

At work I use a [Logitech MX1000 laser cordless mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Logitech_products#Optical_mice), and as soon as they do a bluetooth version I'm getting one.  It'll work great with my PowerBook and I won't need the USB docking station thingy.

Currently listening to: <strong>Speak To Me / Breathe</strong> from the album "Dark Side Of The Moon" by [Pink Floyd](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Pink Floyd%22).  Wasn't it great to see them back together at Live8?
