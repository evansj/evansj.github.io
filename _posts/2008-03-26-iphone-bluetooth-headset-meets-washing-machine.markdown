Well the inevitable has eventually happened, my Apple Bluetooth Headset has been put through a full 40&deg;C cycle in the washing machine. Not only that, my iPhone stereo headset was in the other pocket.

The headset microphone seemed to be broken so I tried to pry it open to dry it out. I just managed to break the clips. After warming it up on my external USB drive all day it has dried out to the point where it might be working OK again, so I'm going to try a bit of superglue to fix the cover back on. In the meantime here is a photo.

My bluetooth headset is still in a bad way. It sort of charges up, but the indicator flashes orange. If you hold the button to turn it on, it does the usual four rising tones but it is very scratchy and crackly. It's also pretty beat up, as it came out of the pocket and rattled round the washing machine drum.

Here's some pictures.
