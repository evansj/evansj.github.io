<p>I've never been much of a keep fit fanatic, and anyone that knows me will tell you that that's a complete understatement.  I've decided to try and rectify that by starting to do a bit more exercise,  i.e. more than none.</p>
<p>To that end I've started jogging.  I've got myself a pair of trainers, and some tracksuit trousers.  A few weeks ago I went out running a couple of times with my brother, but for some reason the momentum was never quite there to go out a third time.  Tonight I went out running with a colleague from work and we are planning to make it a thrice-weekly event.  There are no shower facilities at work so the plan is to set off straight after work, then at least we can head straight home  afterwards.</p>
<p>Tonight we ran for about 45 minutes, from work to Buckingham town and back.  It's now three hours later and my legs still feel like jelly.</p>
