<p>The Two Ronnies are <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1435904,00.html">returning to the TV</a>!</p>I watched Ronnie Corbett host <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/classic/A841772">Have I Got News For You</a> a few weeks back, and it was hilarious.  Even when he
wasn't telling jokes I was laughing.  He could read a tax return and it'd be funny.</p>
