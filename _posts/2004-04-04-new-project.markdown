I have bought a new alarm system for my car.  The factory alarm still works, but the remote doesn't any more.  Also even when it did work you had to be standing right next to the car anyway - it uses infra-red technology so you need line-of-sight from the transmitter to the receiver (next to the sunroof switch).The alarm system I've purchased is a two way paging alarm from Mannix.  No, I've never heard of Mannix either!  It's a well packaged system though, and the installation manual is very comprehensive.  It's recommended that you get a professional to install it... well, I'm a professional software developer, will that do?This weekend I've stripped out a fair amount of interior trim, but unfortunately ran out of time (and nice weather) so I'll have to fit the alarm in instalments over lunch breaks.  I might be able to grab some time next weekend as well to finish it off.
