Over the last couple of days I've managed to make some progress with the alarm. This afternoon the remote start worked for the first time! There's something a bit creepy about watching a car start itself with nobody sat in it.

I've still got a few things left to wire in:

* Parking lights (they flash when you arm or disarm, and light up when the engine is running)
* The alarm sounder (I also need to find a space for it under the bonnet)
* The door open switches
* The boot and bonnet switches
* The vibration sensor (needs mounting on the bodywork somewhere)
* Boot open solenoid (needs some thought...)
* Probably some other stuff

There is no remote boot release on my car, but I've got a spare solenoid that might work... that's the last job though when the rest of it is installed.
