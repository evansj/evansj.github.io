<p>My current phone is a SonyEricsson P900, which I got nearly a year ago on an Orange contract.  Before that I had a Nokia 7650 on SinglePoint.  Last night while running a bath for the kids I got a phone call from someone at Vodafone.  They asked me if I wanted to return - the guy said that they weren't dealing with SinglePoint any more as it had cost them too many users.  I questioned him further and he said that they'd bought out SinglePoint and immediately got rid of 50% of their staff.  It seems that SinglePoint had such a bad customer services reputation that customers were leaving in droves.</p>
<p>I've just had a gander at the <a class="external" href="http://www.vodafone.com/">Vodafone</a> website, and there is a press release confirming that they have bought out SinglePoint for &pound;405m.  However it's written in fairly glowing terms and doesn't even hint at any problems with SinglePoint</p>
<p>I didn't really mind the intrusion, the guy was quite pleasant, and it was useful information.  For the moment though I'm quite happy with <a class="external" href="http://www.orange.co.uk/">Orange</a>.</p>
