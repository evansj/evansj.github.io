When I removed my MacBook from its [Second Skin][cancom] this evening at about 19:00, it was almost too hot to hold.
I put it to sleep at work (by closing the lid) at about 17:35.  It obviously didn't sleep,
or something woke it up.  The fan was running at its fastest speed, but the machine was unresponsive -
I couldn't even get the screen backlight to come on.  I forced it off by holding the power switch,
and when it came on again it was fine - although the fan stayed running for another 5 minutes.

It's the first time it's happened and I've had it for over 2 months now.  Odd.
