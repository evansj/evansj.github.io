For a long time now I've noticed that the steering is a bit twitchy, and occasionally the car will get diverted from its course for no apparent reason.  I've replaced the entire front end except for the steering gearbox.  Well, today I entrusted it to a local BMW specialists to have the steering gearbox replaced.

I haven't yet taken it on a long enough drive to see if it has sorted the problem.

I have retained the old gearbox in case I decide to get it overhauled for sale on eBay.  I have one comment: it's bloody heavy!
