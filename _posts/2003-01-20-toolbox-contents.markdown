In the lid of the boot you will find the BMW toolbox.  Sometimes some tools are missing because previous owners lose them, this is what you should find in there.

* At the back: warning triangle
* At the front, from left to right:
	1.	Spanner 8mm / 10mm
	2.	Spanner 12mm / 13mm
	3.	Spanner 17mm / 19mm
	4.	Water pump pliers
	5.	tool to help you re-fit the road wheels
	6.	Spark plug socket (use the screwdriver as a handle)
	7.	Screwdriver
	8.	Allen key for emergency sunroof closing (not shown)
	9.	Security key for wheel bolts

As BMWs are European, everything is in metric, which is a good thing. :-)

Since the photo was taken I bought a replacement allen key from the dealer, it only cost a few pounds.
