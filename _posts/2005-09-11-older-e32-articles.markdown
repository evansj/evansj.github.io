Last month I imported all of my old BMW E32 Articles to this site, but I was contacted by a reader pointing out that many of them had broken image links in them.  This was due to the way I put the site together on my server before uploading it all to my web host.  All of the images ended up with URLs pointing to the temporary host I set up on my server while I was configuring it.  I've fixed them all now, as far as I can see.  I've also set up an [index page which lists all of the repair articles I wrote for my E32](/category/bmw-repairs/list).
