Hello world!

I thought I'd update my blog before I make it to the 1 year anniversary of my last post.

Here's a Genius playlist which my iPhone picked for my journey home from work today. Every track a winner! I really like the Genius feature in iTunes, it's usually spot on.

<li><b>Step It Up</b> - Stereo MC's <i>(#12 in 1993)</i></li>
<li><b>Hit</b> - Sugarcubes <i>(#17 in 1991, just before Bj&ouml;rk left for solo stardom)</i></li>

</ol>

I was stuck in traffic around <i>Happy Talk</i> / <i>Hourglass</i> / <i>Step On</i> (roadworks at Deddington). I hope the occupants of the Galaxy in front of me enjoyed watching me singing along.

I got home as <i>Horace Wimp</i> was starting, but the rest of the tracks were also pretty good so I put those in the list as well. If you've got <a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a>, here's a <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/burmasauce/playlist/1b22iDU9EPXwUmSPkD0Ln4">link to a Spotify playlist</a> with all the tracks in it, except <i>Close (To the Edit)</i> and <i>Arnold Layne</i>, which Spotify didn't have. As a bonus though, I've put <i>This Month, Day 10</i> in there, the single that CSS should have released.
