<p>My son James is five years old.  This morning (10th January), before we left the house, we'd remarked to him that it would probably be indoor playtime today because of the weather.</p>

<p>It's about 20 minutes drive from our house to James' school.  As I was walking him from the car to school, our conversation went like this:</p>

<blockquote><ul style="list-style-type: none"><p><li>Me: So, what do you normally do if it's a wet playtime?</li><li>James: Well last time, on October 13th, year 3 and 4 came into the hall to play with us.</li><li>Me: That's amazing!  You remember the actual date?</li><li>James: Yes, it was Jake's birthday.</li></ul></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the question is, should I check with his teacher to see if he's right?</p>
