<p><b>Step 1</b> open the fusebox - it is located near the windscreen on
the left hand side of the car.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> ease open the three clips around the bottom of the relay
and pull off the plastic lid </p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> examine the circuit board.  You will no doubt find many
bad solder joints.  The easiest thing to do is resolder all of them.  I used
a 25 watt soldering iron, my 15 watt wasn't up to the job.  </p>

<p>As you can see, most of my solder joints have gone bad.  I've labeled
a couple of them. </p>
<p>If you <em>really</em> want to do the job properly, desolder the
relays first to remove all the old solder.  This step is strictly
optional!</p>

<p><b>Step 5</b> clip the relay back together and return it to the car. </p>
