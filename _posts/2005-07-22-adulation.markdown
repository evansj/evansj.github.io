<p>For three days in the week, I take my 4-year-old son to nursery in the mornings.  Just lately he's been doing something that gets me very strange looks from the staff.</p>
<p>I say goodbye, and give him a kiss.  Then I move away from him, and he throws himself up at me so I have to pick him up.  Then I say goodbye again and give him another kiss.  When I put him down, he prostrates himself in front of me and kisses my feet.</p>

<p>I have no idea where he got the idea from, but the staff at the nursery must think I rule my house with an iron fist.</p>
